# Secretshop 🎮 



Secretshop is an one-stop online marketplace where users can put up listings to buy, trade or sell console games. We built Secretshop because we noticed the absence of a peer-to-peer platform for avid gamers in Singapore to exchange second-hand video games.

We are currently taking a break from the development of this project.

## Features ✨

- Search through hundreds of listings using our filters
- Create your listings by simply by signing up and filling up a form
- Add a wishlist on your profile page and check out what others have in their inventory!
- Notify sellers you are interested in their listing using our realtime chat feature

## Tech Stack ⚙️
Secretshop was built using the following open source framework and libraries:

- [ReactJS] - Library for building front end UI components
- [Express] - Fast Node.js network app framework 
- [NodeJS] - Evented I/O for the backend
- [MongoDB] - One of the most popular non-relational databases for web apps
- [Socket.IO] - Enables realtime, bi-direction communication between web clients and servers

## Installation 📥

After cloning the repository, install the dependencies and devDependencies on both the frontend and backend. 

```sh
cd secret-shop-sg/ frontend
yarn
cd ../backend
yarn
```

## Usage 🖥️ 

From the root directory, first start the backend server
```sh
cd backend
yarn start
```
Using another terminal instance, navigate back to the root dirctory and run the following code to start the frontend server
```sh

```
